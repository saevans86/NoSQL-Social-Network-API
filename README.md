# NoSQL-Social-Network-API




- My motivation for this project was to get a better understanding of client side API's. 
- This project was fun and challenging. With very little experience outside of MySQL, I feel this was one that taught me the most about CRUD methods. With another backend API project under my belt using MySQL, I feel this project solidified what knowledge I have, and helped me understand the process even more. It definitely gives me a greater appreciate for MySQl.  
- What I like about this project most is that it can be transformed in multiple ways, or even modified/used to make other client side API projects. 
- Some of the key take aways from this project would be utilizing a subdocument schema inside of a model, as well as the way each file communicates, at first I completely failed to test my end points, as I felt they *should* work, and it was proven to me that endpoint tests are just as important in the beginning stages.
